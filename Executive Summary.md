#Executive Summary
.

##Problem Statement
  This report provides an analysis to using external sources while writing code for use in a company.  There are many potential issues when using external sources in code, but there are benefits as well.  One of the many problems is that the code was not tested and contains many vulnerabilities.  If there is vulnerabilities management will then have to decide if these issues fit within the policy the company has set forth or if the code will have to be redone.  

##Solution
  A potential solution to the problems of using external sources is running each file or package through a scan for vulnerabilities.  The NIST database is a perfect solution to the problems of vulnerabilities.  After NIST scans the files and packages then management will have to come to the conclusion of whether or not to use the code based on the policy set forth pertaining to the situation.
